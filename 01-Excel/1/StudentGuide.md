# Activities Preview

* **Welcome and Intro Presentations**
* The purpose of this next section is to get to know one another.

    * You will be working with your groups on the next activity.

* **Thought Experiment #1**
* This thought experiment focuses on this question: "Which do Americans prefer: Italian food or Mexican food?" 

  * The task is to develop a strategy for answering this question in 10 hours or less, using data.

  * The premise of the question might seem silly, but it's actually a great learning experiment because it forces one to ask questions.

  * If you need more motivation, consider that:

    * You are up for a promotion and your entire promotion rests on answering this question.

    * You are advising a restaurateur who is about to invest millions in a franchising opportunity. She needs to know which type of cuisine to invest in.

  * The key here is to engage in meaningful conversations with each other and the instructional staff!

* **Thought Experiment #2**
* The second thought experiment is about gentrification, the social phenomenon by which low-income neighborhoods experience an influx of affluent residents.
  
  * Files/Instructions:** [README.md](Activities/02-Stu_Predict_Gentrification/README.md)

  * Use the analytics paradigm discussed earlier to inform how one lays out the strategy as well as seek out potential data sources.
