# Unit 1.3 - Charting a New Course With Excel

## Overview

Today's class will introduce students to both basic and advanced charting in Excel, teaching them everything they need to know to make data visualizations.

## Class Objectives

* Students will create, modify, and stylize basic charts from scratch using Microsoft Excel.
* Students will comfortable creating scatter plots and trend lines.
* Students will have a firm understanding of how to create charts that contain filtered data.
* Students will know how to create regressions and calculate moving averages using Excel.

# Activities Preview

* **Adding files to Github**
* GitHub offers a centralized location where all developers can push and pull (upload and download) their code. GitHub always holds the most up-to-date code and files, handling everyone's updates appropriately. For now, we will only need to know how to use the GUI for Github in order to submit homework. Later in the course, we will learn to work with Github through the terminal using Git.

  * Visit <https://github.com> and login to your accounts. From the main page, create a new repository with an initialized `README.md` file. The convention in the software world is for each repository to have a "README" file that explains what the repository contains.

  * Switch back to the Desktop and create a new empty Excel file and save it. This will be used to demonstrate how to upload new files.

  * Navigate back to Github website and click **Upload files**.

  * Choose your Excel file in the dialog box; instead of the "Upload Files" button, you may also drag files from your desktop to the Github web page for a repo. Add a commit message and commit the changes.

  * Finally, refresh the web page to show that the new file is now safely saved to the repository.

* **The Line and Bar Grades**
* For this activity, you are going to take the role of a teacher as you create a series of bar and line graphs that visualize the grades of your class over the course of a semester.

* **Video Game Sales**
* Looking into a product's sales within a region and comparing it to that product's sales worldwide is a great way to determine how important a region is to a company. In this activity, students will pair up in order to create a series of scatter plots which will compare video game sales across regions.

* **Filter Game Sales**
* Now that we know how to apply filters to a spreadsheet and create charts based on filtered data sets, lets take some time to create charts which compare the sales of publishers against one another.
