# 18.1: R We There Yet

## Overview

Today's class will be a relatively short, but an impactful introduction to R. Despite some substantial differences, it shares many similarities with Python. By the end of the lesson, students will be able to leverage their knowledge of Python and pandas into revisiting data analysis tasks they performed in the fourth week, this time in R.

## Class Objectives

* Students will learn the basics of R syntax.
* Students will learn the fundamental R data types.
* Students will gain familiarity with RStudio.
* Students will learn how to create tibbles.
* Students will be able to manipulate data in tibbles.
* Students will be able to compare and contrast the features of Python and R.

# Activities Preview

* **We R in Junior High Again**
* In this activity, students will practice the basics of R syntax. They will create vectors, use for-loops, use if/else statements, identify substrings of strings, and create functions.

  * Files/Instructions: [Activities/02_Stu_RBasics](Activities/02_Stu_RBasics)

* **Discussion**
* In this activity, students will pair up with a partner. Each partner will ensure that his or her partner is able to load `data.csv` in RStudio.

  * The `tidyverse` package is required for the `read_csv()` function. Technically, only the `readr` package, which comes with `tidyverse`, is required, but we use `tidyverse` here for convenience.
  
  * Students will also discuss the syntax of R, comparing and contrasting it with those of Python and JavaScript. Which features are similar, and which are different from those Python and JavaScript? Among the topics to discuss are:

    * Assignment operator used to assign a variable
    * Declaring a function
    * Basic data structures
    * Concatenating a string
    * Logical operators (they will have to research on logical operators in R)
    * If/Else statements

* **Back to School**
* This activity will revisit the PySchool homework assignment from the fourth week: this time in R!

  * Files/Instructions:

    * [Activities/06_Stu_Tibble](Activities/06_Stu_Tibble)

    * Students will perform some of the same data operations they ran in the homework assignment, including the following:

      * A list of all schools
      * Calculate the total count of schools
      * Calculate the total number of students
      * Calculate the average reading and math scores
      * Calculate the percentage of students with passing reading scores, i.e. over 70%.
      * Calculate the percentage of students with passing math scores, i.e. over 70%.
      * Calculate the overall passing rate, i.e. the average of math and reading passing percentages
