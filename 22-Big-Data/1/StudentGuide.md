# Unit 22.1 - Introduction to Big Data

## Overview

Today's class starts with an overview of big data and then covers how to write Hadoop MapReduce jobs with a Python library called mrjob. The last part of the lesson introduces students to the Spark ecosystem through PySpark.

## Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

* Identify the pieces of the Hadoop ecosystem.

* Identify the differences and similarities between Hadoop and Spark.

* Write MapReduce jobs locally with mrjob.

* Manipulate data using PySpark DataFrames.
