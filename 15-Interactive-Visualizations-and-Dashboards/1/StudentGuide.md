# Unit 15.1 - Introduction to Plotly.js

## Overview

Today's lesson plan introduces students to [Plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/), a high-level wrapper around D3.js. The entire Plotly unit aims to strengthen students' JavaScript skills. Today, students will be introduced to JavaScript's math library, as well revisit functional programming in JavaScript.

## Class Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use Plotly to create basic charts, including bar charts and line charts.
* Use Plotly's `layout` object to customize the appearance of their charts.
* Annotate charts with labels, text, and hover text.
* Use JavaScript's math library to generate random integers.
* Use filter() and arrow functions to manipulate and filter datasets.
