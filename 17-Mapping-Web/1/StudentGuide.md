# Unit 17.1 - Data Visualization with Leaflet

## Overview

Today's lesson will be spent introducing students to data visualization with maps. Students will gain a basic understanding of the Leaflet.js mapping library before diving headfirst into a number of increasingly involved examples.

## Class Objectives

* Students will understand the benefits that visualizing data with maps can provide.
* Students will learn the basics of creating maps and plotting data with the Leaflet.js library.
* Students will gain an understanding of the GeoJSON format.
* Students will understand the concept of layers and layer controls and how we can use them to add interactivity to our maps.

# Activities Preview

* **Quick Labeling Exercise**
* In this activity students will be plotting markers for various US Cities using Leaflet.

  * Instructions: [README](Activities/03-Stu_City_Markers/README.md)

* **Other Types Of Markers**
* In this activity students will work with different types of vector layers.

  * Instructions: [README](Activities/05-Stu_Other_Markers/README.md)

* **World Cup Visualized**
* In this activity students will create graduated circle maps to represent the total amount of all-time 3 point wins for the top ten countries in the Fifa World Cup.

  * Instructions: [README](Activities/07-Stu_Country_World_Cup/README.md)

* **Layer Activity**
* For this activity, we will return to our US cities map and re-factor the code to use layer groups and a layer control. In so doing, we will be able to represent the population for the entire state as well as the city.

  * Instructions: [README](Activities/09-Stu_City_Population_Layers/README.md)

* **GeoJSON activity**
* For this activity students will be working with GeoJSON data to plot occurrences of earthquakes.

  * Instructions: [README](Activities/10-Stu_Geo-Json/README.md)
