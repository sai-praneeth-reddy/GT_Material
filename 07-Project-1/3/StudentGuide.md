# Unit 7.3 - Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Tests

## Overview

Today's lesson plan introduces students to basics of Hypothesis testing and a handful of statistical tests.

## Class Objectives

* Students will be able to apply ANOVA to compare the means of three or more groups

# Activities Preview
* **Forming a Null Hypothesis**
* The students are to work in pairs to convert the following questions into Hypothesis and Null Hypothesis

  * Files/Instructions:

    * [01-Par_Null_Hypothesis/README.md](Activities/01-Par_Null_Hypothesis/README.md)

    * Convert the following Questions into an Hypothesis and Null Hypothesis

      1. Does Dark Chocolate affect arterial function in healthy individuals?

      2. Does Coffee have anti-aging properties?

* **T-Test**
* This activity will use a t-test to compare the differences in Adult Sardine Vertebrae counts from two different locations.

  * Files/Instructions:

    * [Stu_Sardines.ipynb](Activities/03-Stu_Sardines/Unsolved/Stu_Sardines.ipynb)

    * Calculate the mean for each population.

    * Use a T-Test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the number of vertebrae of Adult Sardines in Alaska vs. San Diego.

    * It is up to you to determine if you should use a One Sample or Independent t-test.

* **ANOVA**
* This activity will use ANOVA to compare the differences in Pain Threshold for people with different hair colors.

  * Files/Instructions:

    * [hair_anova.ipynb](Activities/05-Stu_ANOVA/Unsolved/hair_anova.ipynb)

    * Perform a one-way ANOVA test to determine if there are any significant differences in Hair Color vs. Pain Threshold.

    * Create a Boxplot to show the distribution of pain tolerances for each hair color.
* **Chi Square**
* In this activity, students will perform the chi-square test: first with Python, then by hand.

  * Files/Instructions:

    * [07-Stu_Chi_Square/README.md](Activities/07-Stu_Chi_Square/README.md)

    * [Stu-Cafes.ipynb](Activities/07-Stu_Chi_Square/Unsolved/Stu-Cafes.ipynb)

* **Project Work**
* Students should spend the remainder of class working with their groups on their project.
