# Unit 10.3 - Introduction to Flask & Serving Data with APIs

## Overview

Today's lesson introduces students to the fundamentals of the web and client-server architecture;  how to use Flask to create a database-backed server; and how to use the same to design and implement API endpoints.

### Class Objectives

* Students will be able to use Flask to create and run a server
* Students will define endpoints using Flask's @app.route decorator
* Students will learn to extract query variable path values from GET requests
* Students will use variable paths to execute database queries on behalf of the client
* Student will learn to return JSONified query results from API endpoints

* **Justice League**
* Students' task for this activity is to create a server configured to send welcome text at its index endpoint, and JSON data at its `api/v1.0/justice-league` endpoint.

* **Chinook Database Analysis**
* This is the final activity for the Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval Unit. The goal of this activity is to give students additional practice in analysis of databases using the SQLAlchemy ORM. Students will be analyzing invoice data from the [Chinook database](https://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Chinook_Schema&referringTitle=Home). You will design SQLAlchemy ORM queries to answer specific questions about the invoice data.
