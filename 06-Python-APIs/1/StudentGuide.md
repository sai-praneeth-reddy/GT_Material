# Unit 6.1 - APIs

## Overview

Today's lesson introduces students to JSON traversal and the fundamentals of making API requests with the [requests library](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), using the [OMDb](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and [New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/) APIs.

### Class Objectives

* Students will be able to make GET requests with `requests`.
* Students will be able to convert JSON into a Python dictionary.
* Students will read and apply API documentation.
* Students will sign up for and use an API key.

# Activities Preview

* **Requesting SpaceX**
* This activity has students dig into a rather simple and well-documented API - The SpaceX API - and asks them to make a couple calls to the API using the Requests library.

  * File/Instructions:

    * [Activities/02-Stu_SpaceX/README.md](Activities/02-Stu_SpaceX/README.md)

    * [02-Stu_SpaceX/Stu_SpaceX.ipynb](Activities/02-Stu_SpaceX/Unsolved/Stu_SpaceX.ipynb)

* **Requesting a Galaxy Far Far Away**
* Students will now create an application that accesses data from the Star Wars API and prints out values from within it.

  * File/Instructions:
  
    * [04-Stu_FarFarAway/README.md](Activities/04-Stu_FarFarAway/README.md)
  
    * [Stu_FarFarAway.ipynb](Activities/04-Stu_FarFarAway/Unsolved/Stu_FarFarAway.ipynb)

* **Number Facts**
* Students will now join forces in creating an interactive application that uses the "numbers" API. The application will take in a number and then return a random fact about that number.

  * File/Instructions:
  
    * [05-Par_NumberFacts/README.md](Activities/05-Par_NumberFacts/README.md)
  
    * [05-Par_NumberFacts/Par_NumberFacts.ipynb](Activities/05-Par_NumberFacts/Unsolved/Par_NumberFacts.ipynb)

* **Study the OMDb API**
* For this first part of the OMDB activity, students will be spending some time reviewing the documentation for the OMDB API and testing it out.

  * Instructions:
  
    * [07-Stu_Explore_OMDb_API/README.md](Activities/07-Stu_Explore_OMDb_API/README.md)

* **Movie Questions**
* The class will now test their skills with the OMDB API as they attempt to collect some data from the API in order to answer a series of questions.

  * File/Instructions:
  
    * [08-Stu_MovieQuestions/README.md](Activities/08-Stu_MovieQuestions/README.md)
  
    * [08-Stu_MovieQuestions/Stu_MovieQuestions.ipynb](Activities/08-Stu_MovieQuestions/Unsolved/Stu_MovieQuestions.ipynb)

* **Iterative Requests**
* The class will now test their knowledge of iterative requests by looping through a list of movies and collecting data from the OMDB API on each movie.

  * File/Instructions:
  
    * [10-Stu_MovieLoop/README.md](Activities/10-Stu_MovieLoop/README.md)
  
    * [10-Stu_MovieLoop/Stu_MovieLoop.ipynb](Activities/10-Stu_MovieLoop/Unsolved/Stu_MovieLoop.ipynb)

* **Retrieving Articles**
* Students will now create an application that grabs articles from the NYT API, stores them within a list, and prints snippets of the articles to the screen.

  * File/Instructions:
  
    * [12-Stu_RetrieveArticles/README.md](Activities/12-Stu_RetrieveArticles/README.md)
  
    * [12-Stu_RetrieveArticles/Stu_Retrieve_Articles.ipynb](Activities/12-Stu_RetrieveArticles/Unsolved/Stu_Retrieve_Articles.ipynb)
