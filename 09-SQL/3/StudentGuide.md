# Unit 9.3 - Data Modeling

## Overview

Today's class will focus on data modeling and best practices for designing a database. Students will learn how to normalize data and how tables in a database are related, as well as how to create visualizations of databases using entity relationship diagrams (ERDs).

## Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, students will be able to:

* Apply data modeling techniques to database design.
* Normalize data.
* Identify data relationships.
* Create visual representations of a database through entity relationship diagrams.

# Activities Preview

* **Pet Normalizer**
* In this activity, students will practice their data normalization skills using the provided data.

  * Files/Instructions:
  
    * [README.md](Activities/02-Stu_Data_Normalization/README.md)

    * [pets.csv](Activities/02-Stu_Data_Normalization/Resources/pets.csv)

* **Foreign Keys**
* In this activity, students will create tables with foreign keys.

  * Files/Instructions:
  
    * [README.md](Activities/04-Stu_Foreign_Keys/README.md)
  
    * [schema.sql](Activities/04-Stu_Foreign_Keys/Unsolved/schema.sql)

* **Data Relationships**
* In this activity, students will create table schemata for students and available courses, and then create a junction table to display all courses taken by students.

  * Instructions: [README.md](Activities/06-Stu_Data_Relationships/README.md)

* **Designing an ERD**
* In this activity, students will create a conceptual ERD for a gym owner.  Students will further improve on the ERD by creating a physical ERD.

  * Files/Instructions:
  
    * [README.md](Activities/08-Par_Designing_ERD/README.md)
  
    * [schema.txt](Activities/08-Par_Designing_ERD/Unsolved/schema.txt)

    * [README.md](Activities/09-Par_ERD/README.md)

    * [schema.txt](Activities/09-Par_ERD/Unsolved/schema.txt)

* **Unions**
* This activity will give students more practice with unions, by combining data from multiple tables without the use of joins.

  * Files/Instructions: [README.md](Activities/11-Stu_Unions/README.md)
