# Unit 14.1 - Intro to JavaScript

## Overview

Today's class will introduce students to the basic syntax of JavaScript.

### Class Objectives

* Students will gain familiarity with JavaScript variables, data types, and statements.
* Students will gain familiarity with basic JavaScript control flow (functions, loops, if/else statements).
* Students will gain familiarity with JavaScript arrays.
* Students will gain familiarity with using and creating functions in JavaScript, including built-in functions.

* **Movie Scores**
* Students will use conditionals and loops to iterate through an array of movie scores and sort scores into new arrays by their values.

* **Statistics Functions**

  * Files/Instructions:

    * [Activities/08-Stu_Stats_Functions/README.md](Activities/08-Stu_Stats_Functions/README.md)

    * [Activities/08-Stu_Stats_Functions/Unsolved/static/js/app.js](Activities/08-Stu_Stats_Functions/Unsolved/static/js/app.js)

    * [Activities/08-Stu_Stats_Functions/Unsolved/index.html](Activities/08-Stu_Stats_Functions/Unsolved/index.html)

    * Using the movie array from earlier as a starting point, create functions that will return statistical values from any given array of data.

    * Create functions that will find the following:

      * Mean
      * Variance
      * Standard Deviation

    * Each function should `console.log` both the name of the statistic used and its value. For example "The Mean is: 33.3".

    * The functions should be able to take any array of numbers and return the statistical value.

    * After you have the functions working with movie data set run them on the following additional data points:

      * `monthlyAvgRainFall = [3.03, 2.48, 3.23, 3.15, 4.13, 3.23]`
      * `mileRunTimes = [5.06, 4.54, 5.56, 4.40, 7.10]`

    * Hints:

      * Use the Javascript Math library to handle calculations needing exponents or square roots.

      * If you need to refresh how to calculate variance and standard deviation, here are some pages to consult:

        * [variance](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/212650/variance-explanation.html)

        * [standard deviation](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html)
