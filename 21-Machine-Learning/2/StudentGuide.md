# Unit 21.2 - Classification

## Overview

Today's lesson plan introduces students to classification algorithms in Scikit-learn.

## Class Objectives

* Students will understand how to calculate and apply the fundamental classification algorithms: logistic regression, SVM, KNN, decision trees, and random forests.

* Students will understand how to quantify and validate classification models including calculating a classification report.

* Students will understand how to apply `GridSearchCV` to hyper tune model parameters.

# Activities Preview

* **Gender Voice Recognition**
* In this activity we will perform logistic regression to our dataset in order to predict the label `male` or `female`.

* **Trees**
* In this activity, the model accuracy is low and the complexity is high. We'll be exploring random forest classifier to explore this dataset.

  * File: [Stu_Trees.ipynb](Activities/04-Stu_Trees/Unsolved/Stu_Trees.ipynb)

* **KNN**
* In this activity we'll use KNN

  * File: [Stu_Brains.ipynb](Activities/06-Stu_KNN/Unsolved/Stu_KNN.ipynb)

* **SVM**

  * File: [Stu_SVM.ipynb](Activities/08-Stu_SVM/Unsolved/Stu_SVM.ipynb)

* **Grid Search**
* In this activity we'll use Grid Search to test our model with several different combinations of parameters and data. Applying GridSearch saves us considerable time vs manually changing these values ourselves.
